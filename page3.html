    Logic
Logic was introduced by John McCarthy into the field of artificial intelligence research in 1958 during his thesis called The Adviser. In 1963, J. Alan Robinson discovered a simple and completely complete algorithmic method for logical inference that could easily be performed by digital computers. However, naive implementation of the algorithms quickly leads to a combinatorial explosion or an endless loop. In 1974, Robert Kowalski proposed representing Boolean expressions in terms of the century (the data in the form of grammar, as: "that p if q"), which reduced Boolean inference to a back or forward sequence. This greatly mitigated (but did not eliminate) the problem.
<br>
Logic is used to represent knowledge and solve problems, but it can be applied to other problems as well. For example, the satplan algorithm uses logic for planning, and inductive logic programming is a learning method. There are several different forms of reasoning used in AI research.

<br>
Propositional or Expressive Logic: It is the logic of statements that can be true or false.
<br>
Primary logic: It also allows the use of words denoting quantity and news, and it can express the facts of things, their properties, and their relationships with each other.
<br>
Approximate logic: a type of elementary logic that allows the truth of a sentence to be represented with a value between 0 and 1, rather than just (1) for true or (0) for false. The approximate system can be used for uncertain reasoning and has been a widely used logic in modern industry and consumer product control systems.
<br>
Hypothetical, non-monotonic and ambient logic: are forms of logic that are designed to aid in hypothetical logic and the qualification problem.
Several extensions of logic are designed to deal with specific areas of knowledge, such as: descriptive logic; arithmetic of the situation, arithmetic of the event and arithmetic (to represent events and time) causal arithmetic; Calculation of belief, the logic of probabilities.
Probabilistic methods of uncertain thinking
<br>
Many problems in AI research (in thinking, planning, learning, understanding and robotics) require an operator to work with incomplete or uncertain information. Beginning in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Yehuda Perle and others advocated the use of methods drawn from probability theory and economics to develop a number of powerful tools to solve these problems. Bayes networks are a very general tool that can be used for a large number of problems: logical reasoning (using the Bayesian default inferential algorithm), learning (using the expectation maximization algorithm), planning (using the decision grid) and visualization (using the Bayesian dynamic network).
<br>
Probabilistic algorithms can also be used for filtering, predicting, smoothing, finding interpretations of data streams, and aiding visualization systems to analyze processes that occur over time (for example, a hidden Markov model) or a Kalman filter.
<br>
A key concept from economics is "feasibility": a measure of knowing the value of something for an intelligent worker. Accurate mathematical tools have been developed to analyze how a worker can choose and plan, using decision theory, decision analysis, and information value theory. These tools include models such as the Markov decision process, dynamic decision network game theory, and mechanism design

Artificial intelligence, in its simplest applications, can be divided into two types: classifiers (“if they are bright they are diamonds”), and consoles
