        Artificial intelligence can be divided into:

Narrow AI
It is artificial intelligence that specializes in one field, for example, there are artificial intelligence systems that can beat the world champion in the game of chess, which is the only thing they do.

artificial general intelligence
This type refers to computers with the level of human intelligence in all fields, that is, it can perform any intellectual task that a person can perform. Creating this type of intelligence is much more difficult than the previous type and we have not reached this level yet.

Super Artificial Intelligence
Oxford philosopher Nick Bostrom defines superintelligence as “thought far smarter than the best human minds in nearly every field, including scientific creativity, general wisdom, and social skills,” and because of this type the field of artificial intelligence is an interesting area to delve into.

artificial intelligence problems
The problem of simulating (or creating) intelligence has been divided into a number of specific sub-problems. These consist of specific traits or capabilities that researchers would like to embody in an intelligent system. The features listed below have received the most attention.

Reasoning, logical thinking, and problem-solving ability
The first researchers in the science of artificial intelligence developed algorithms that simulate the sequential logical reasoning that humans do when solving puzzles, playing backgammon or logical deductions.

In the 1980s and 1990s, artificial intelligence research led to highly successful ways of dealing with uncertain or incomplete information, using concepts from probability and economics.

For difficult problems, most of these algorithms require huge computational resources—resulting in a "combination explosion": the amount of memory or time needed for computers becomes astronomical when the problem exceeds a certain size. The search for algorithms that are more capable of solving problems is a top priority for AI research.

Humans solve most of their problems using intuitive, rather than conscious, quick judgments, by step-by-step deduction that early AI researchers were able to simulate automatically. AI research has made some progress in imitating this "sub-symbolic" type of problem-solving skills: the approaches involved underscore the importance of sensorimotor skills for higher thinking; And attempts to research in the field of neural networks and simulate the structures inside the brain of humans and animals that lead to the emergence of this skill
