    Research and optimization
Crystal Clear app kdict.pngâ€‚Mathematics of representation
Many AI problems can theoretically be solved by intelligent searching in many possible solutions: [346] logical reasoning can be reduced to research. For example, logical evidence can be thought of as a search for a path from assumptions to outcomes, where each step is an application of the rule of inference. Schematic algorithms search through sub-goals, trying to find the way to the goal, a process called means-end analysis. Robotic algorithms use local search engines to move the limbs and ingest objects in the configuration space. Many learning algorithms use search algorithms based on optimization.
Simple comprehensive research is seldom enough for most real-world problems: the search space (the number of search places) to grow rapidly to astronomical numbers. The result is a search that is very slow or a search that never gets done. For many problems, the solution is to use "heuristics" or "rules of experience" that eliminate options that are unlikely to lead to the goal (this is called "pruning a search tree"). Inference provides the program with a "best guess" through the solution.

A very different type of research emerged in the 1990s, based on mathematical optimization theory. For many problems, it is possible to start the research process with some form of guesswork, and then gradually adjust the guess until it is so optimal that no improvements can be made. These algorithms can be visualized as blind hill-climbing: the search begins at a random point on the scene, and then, some hops or steps, we keep moving a guess up that hill, until we reach the top. Other optimization algorithms include annealing simulation, ray search and random optimization.

Evolutionary accounting uses a form of optimal research. For example, you might start from organisms with a population (speculations), then allow them to mutate and recombine, choosing only the fittest to survive each generation (refining guesses). Forms of computational evolution include swarm intelligence algorithms (such as ant colony or particle swarm optimization), evolutionary algorithms (such as genetic algorithms), and genetic programming.
